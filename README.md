# sastantua @ 42
```
Allosimanius Syneca is a planet noted for ice, snow, mind-hurtling beauty and
stunning cold. The view from the top of the Ice Crystal Pyramids of Sastantua
is widely known for its ability to release the observerâ€™s mind to hitherto
unexperienced horizons of beauty.
```

This is one of the numerous projects done during the 42 piscine in July 2015.
It was completed in a week and can display fancy pyramids in ASCII that follow
a simple set of rules. The objective was to recreate the output of a given
binary perfectly.

The unix utility [`diff`](http://linux.die.net/man/1/diff) was useful when
testing.

## Compiling
The project currently only has the functions for generating the pyramid. To
compile, you will need a main. Assuming you have a working
[libft](https://github.com/pbondoer/42-libft):

```c
#include "libft.h"

int	main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
	if (argc < 2)
		return 0;

	sastantua(ft_atoi(argv[1]));
}
```

Alternatively, you can replace `ft_atoi` with the standard `atoi` 
implementation (using `stdlib.h` instead).

## Usage
Compiling this into a `sastantua` executable, you get:

```
$ ./sastantua 3

               /*\
              /***\
             /*****\
          /***********\
         /*************\
        /***************\
       /*****************\
    /***********************\
