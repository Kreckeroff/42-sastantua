# sastantua @ 42
```
Allosimanius Syneca is a planet noted for ice, snow, mind-hurtling beauty and
stunning cold. The view from the top of the Ice Crystal Pyramids of Sastantua
is widely known for its ability to release the observerâ€™s mind to hitherto
unexperienced horizons of beauty.

This is one of the numerous projects done during the 42 piscine in July 2015. It was completed in a week and can display fancy pyramids in ASCII that follow a simple set of rules. The objective was to recreate the behavior of a given executable as closely as possible.

## Compiling
The project currently only has the functions for generating the pyramid. Here's a simple main (assuming you have a working [libft](https://github.com/pbondoer/42-libft)):

```c
#include "libft.h"

int	main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
	if (argc < 2)
		return 0;

	sastantua(ft_atoi(argv[1]));
}
```

Alternatively, you can replace `ft_atoi` with the standard `atoi` implementation (using `stdlib.h` instead).

## Usage
Compiling this into a `sastantua` executable, you get:

```
$ ./sastantua 3

               /*\
              /***\
             /*****\
          /***********\
         /*************\
        /***************\
       /*****************\
    /***********************\
   /*************************\
  /************|||************\
 /*************|||*************\
/**************|||**************\
```

## A little note for 42 students
Hi! This is the first bonus project for the 42 piscine. If you're here and you didn't try anything before, you should definitely give it a try. It's not as hard as it seems! Think about it: the pyramids are generated in a very predictable way.

You might want to check `man diff` and [redirectors](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Redirections.html). It's helped me make sure mine was correct!

Good luck, and thanks for all the fish!
